You will receive a topic and get 2 minutes to prepare for a 5 minute speech. The topics may vary from something as concrete as "stones" to something abstract like "courage." This event challenges you with a race against time to create an innovative speech.

    <h3 class="event">Interp</h3>
    <br>
    <h4 class="spec">Dramatic Interpretation (DI)</h4>
    <p class="ibios">DI gives you the opportunity to develop and refine your skills as an actor as well as learn and enact your character's emotions. You can choose a book, film, play, an autobiography, etc. to create your piece from. You will learn how to choose the right piece, cut it, block it, then act it. If you're good, you could even make your audience cry!</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="spec">Humorous Interpretation (HI)</h4>
    <p class="ibios">Ever wanted to make people laugh until they cry? HI gives you the ability to take a published piece of work of your choice and put a humorous twist on it. You will learn how to act out multiple characters, being as silly as you want to be while learning important presentation skills.  </p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="spec">Duo Interpretation (DUO)</h4>
    <p class="ibios">Three's a crowd, but two isn't! DUO is the only event in speech that allows you to work with a partner, choosing a published piece of work and acting it out together. It can be funny, sad, scary, whatever you want, and you get to have a blast doing it with your friend! There's a catch though: you can't look or touch your partner. You get to be creative and work on teamwork, reliability, as well as presentation skills. </p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="spec">Thematic Interpretation (TI)</h4>
    <p class="ibios">Love drama, but love comedy? Can't decide between DI and HI? TI is your solution! TI focuses on a central theme or idea and finding three or more published pieces that can be sad or happy. Also, this is the only event in interpretation that allows you to use a prop: a small black binder. This forces you to be creative in the ways you use your binder throughout your speech.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="spec">Oratorical Interpretation (DI)</h4>
    <p class="ibios">You find a published speech, memorize it, and perform it. Only thing you have to do is interpret the author's voice and recite it that same way.      </p>
