We have had several debates in school and I felt prepared and confident to speak in front of many people when we had presentations and speeches. At camp we learned the process on how to write cases and speeches, what would happen at a real speech/debate tournament, and at the end we actually got to debate against other people. It was also very fun interacting with high school kids who are also your teachers. They make sure you aren't stressed out in any way and help you whenever needed. Overall, my friends and I had a great time both years and it was very useful."</p></center></td>

And with very caring and encouraging teachers and assistant teachers as well as outgoing and supportive classmates, Lynbrook's debate camp is a definite way to have fun and most certainly to find your voice!"</p></center></td>
