    <p>Lynbrook Speech and Debate is excited to host our 11th year of speech and debate summer camp. This camp is open to incoming 4th-9th graders, for both beginners and experienced students. The students will be separated by age group and skill level so we can tailor the curriculum to maximize their learning experience. With Lynbrook’s professional coach as well as seasoned high school speech and debaters guiding the students, we guarantee a 7:1 student to teacher ratio for each classroom activity to ensure individualized feedback to help the students improve the most.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This year, with our invigorating curriculum for the students enrolled, we hope to give students a greater exposure to the value of speech and debate. This collaboration will ensure that we have more than enough instructors for students, guaranteeing success.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The camp will first be focused on speech-writing and speech delivery to hone the students' ability to put their thoughts on paper and translate them into coherent words when speaking. Then, students will learn proper techniques of argumentation and how to construct arguments, with lessons and practice on actual debating. The camp will culminate with an intra-camp tournament in which students will debate against each other to apply their knowledge in a practical situation, and have the opportunity to earn a scholarship of $100.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The camp will take place at Lynbrook High School, from 9:00 AM – 3:00 PM. This year we are offering to camp sessions:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Session 1: June 10th to June 14th </p>
    <p>Session 2: July 29th to August 2nd </p>

    <p>Our student instructors are well-versed in the events that Speech and Debate has to offer. Lynbrook SD students have qualified to nationally recognized tournaments, from the State Championships to competitions as large as the Tournament of Champions. That being said, we hope to pass on this knowledge and experience to our students. With Lynbrook’s seasoned high school speech and debaters guiding the students, we guarantee individualized feedback to help the students improve the most. Moreover, instructors for the Camp have been accepted by many prestigious universities, including MIT, Stanford, Yale, UPenn, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, Rice, UC Berkeley, UCLA, and more, and have extensive debate experience.</p>
    <p>Your children will have the amazing opportunity to work with all of these team members and many more during the summer. After nine years of summer camps, we hope that this will be the most enjoyable for your students.</p>
