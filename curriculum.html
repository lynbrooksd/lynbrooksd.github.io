        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <h3>Speechwriting</h3>
        <p>Students will work with camp instructors to learn how to effectively choose a speech topic, create an efficient outline, and write a complete and organized speech that covers every aspect of their chosen topic. Instructors will go over strategies and shortcuts in aiding students with their speeches, giving each student individual attention to ensure that by the end of Camp, each student is capable of writing a 3-5 minute speech on their own. Our instructors are among the top high school Speech students in the nation, qualifying multiple times to the Tournament of Champion and placing 8th in the California State Tournament for Speech.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Tuesday</h2>
        <h3>Speaking and Presentation</h3>
        <p>After learning how to write a speech, instructors will work with students to conquer their fear of public speaking and practice giving oral presentations. Students will be asked to first give a speech on their chosen topic in front of a small group of 5-6 students, and then to present their speech to the entire class. Instructors will provide personalized feedback and hold practice sessions to improve public speaking skills even further, improving pitch, volume, and rate of speaking. Students will play speech-improving games with the instructors to make public speaking both fun and educational.</p>

        <h3>Debate Argumentation Including Cross-examination</h3>
        <p>An argument is a complex thing. On Thursday, there will be a lecture on the nuances of an argument, including discussion on the three specific components that comprise a formal argument. In addition, there will be a lecture on the usage of Cross-Examination, a period of time in debate during when opposing debaters are allowed to question each other, in strategic and valuable ways to enhance your own chances of winning while setting your opponents up to fail.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <h3>Intra-camp Tournament</h3>
        <p>On the final day of the camp, the students will put everything theyâ€™ve learned so far to the test in an intra-camp debate tournament involving all of the students competing against one another! Those who perform superbly will be recognized in front of the entire camp with certificates and $50 gift cards. The tournament will consist of 3-4 debate rounds and a concluding final rounds between the top two teams.</p>
